### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

<!--
**HugoGW/HugoGW** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:
- ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @HugoGW (Hugo ALEXANDRE from France), I'm 23 years old and i'm looking for a PhD thesis in the field of gravitational waves.
- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on gravitational waves (gravitational background) and cosmology.
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning to improve my Python skills in simulation as I would like to work on gravitational wave simulation and modeling (CBC, MSP...).
- ğŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on labs that worked on GW.
- ğŸ’¬ Ask me about whatever you want
- ğŸ“« You can reach me on my mail : hugoalexandre127@gmail.com
- âš¡ Fun fact: I'm french and i love wine and cheese which is quite common :/
--> I also have a tiktok account : 1minute2pÄ§ysique. I posted videos about (astro)physcis (demonstrations of equations, fun facts etc.)
