### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @HugoGW (Hugo ALEXANDRE from France), I'm 23 years old and i'm looking for a PhD thesis in the field of gravitational waves.
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on gravitational waves (gravitational background) and cosmology (internships) but next step would be a PhD thesis.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning to improve my Python skills in simulation as I would like to work on gravitational wave simulation and modeling (CBC, MSP...).
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on labs that worked on GW.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about whatever you want :)
- ðŸ“« You can reach me on my mail : hugoalexandre127@gmail.com
- âš¡ Fun fact: I'm french and i love wine, cheese and baguette bread which is quite common in France (yeah, we embody our stereotypes) :/
--> I also have a tiktok account : @1minute2pÄ§ysique. I posted content about (astro)physics (demonstrations of equations, fun facts etc.)
