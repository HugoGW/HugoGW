- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @HugoGW (Hugo ALEXANDRE from France), I'm 23 years old and i'm looking for a PhD thesis in the field of gravitational waves.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in Astrophysics and physics and especially in gravitational waves. I also like practising sports like Handball.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning to improve my Python skills in simulation as I would like to work on gravitational wave simulation and modeling (CBC, MSP...).
- ðŸ“« You can reach me on my mail : hugoalexandre127@gmail.com
